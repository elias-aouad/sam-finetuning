# Segment Anything

Hi, this a repository that provides pieces of code that can be used for finetuning a Segment Anything model using the refiners library.

Although it is not fully ready to be launched, it provides the key ideas behind the finetuning, such as :

- Defining a specific Trainer

- Defining specific Callbacks

- Defining specific Trainer Config

- Defining Specific dataset structure
