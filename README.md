# SAM Finetunning

Hi, this is a repository that provides basic commands for finetuning SAM.

These commands include :

- Generating a dataset (in the `dataset` folder)

- Defining the right configurations and classes for training SAM (in the `sam` folder)


PS : You can find a v0 version of a dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C8eu6NEJR4YHJDTAAy1yIqcvk0ThK--l?usp=share_link)
